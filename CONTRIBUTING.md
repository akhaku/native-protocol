# Contributing guidelines

## Design goals

* no runtime dependencies
* extensibility: it is possible to add new message codecs, new subcodecs for result kinds, errors
  and even a whole new protocol version 

## Code formatting

We follow the [Google Java Style Guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/javaguide.html). See
https://github.com/google/google-java-format for IDE plugins. The rules are not configurable.

The build will fail if the code is not formatted. To format all files from the command line, run:
 
```
mvn fmt:format -Dformat.validateOnly=false
```

## License headers

The build will fail if some license headers are missing. To update all files from the command line,
run:

```
mvn license:format
```

## Pre-commit hook (highly recommended)
 
Ensure `pre-commit.sh` is executable, then run:

```
ln -s ../../pre-commit.sh .git/hooks/pre-commit
```

This will only allow commits if the tests pass. It is also a good reminder to keep the test suite
short.
